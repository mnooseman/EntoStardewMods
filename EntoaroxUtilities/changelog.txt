0.1.0-internal.3
- Added missing tools to `sdv.tools`
- Fixed support for tv's in `sdv.furniture`
- Fixed support for slingshots in `sdv.weapon`
- Changed `sdv.artisan` so it should work for items provided through TypeHandlers other then `sdv.object`
    It loops through all handlers for the given Id, and accepts the first valid match
- Added 2 new API methods to enable custom TypeHandlers to do what `sdv.artisan` does
    > string ResolveFirstMatchingTypeId(string id, List<string> excludedTypes = null);
    > string ResolveFirstMatchingTypeId<TClass>(string id, List<string> excludedTypes = null) where TClass : Item;
    Second option enables defining a sub-class of Item that the item needs to be assignable to for a match to be valid
    The returned string is the full TypeId, which can be used with the normal method to get the actual Item instance

0.1.0-internal.4
- Added support for CustomFarmingRedux machines (`cf.machine`) - if that mod is installed
- Reorganised code to better separate externals from internals
- Initial attempt at reverse-lookup implemented, due to how SDV handles items, reverse-lookups can fail.
    - Reverse-lookup can by default return "unreliable" TypeId's, to disable this behaviour set the strict parameter to `true`
        (A unreliable TypeId is one which matches in the current session, but may no longer match after loading a new save or restarting the game)
- Reverse-lookup support for PrismaticTools added
- Exported Mappings into separate JSON files
- Changed how reverse-mappings work to improve handling
- Adding logging to report on TypeId status
- Mapping for sdv.weapon, sdv.hat and sdv.furniture added.
- Support for 1.4 Clothing added (Not yet mapped)
- Added mappings for the 1.4 items in existing mappings

0.1.0-internal.5
- Added partial mappings for Clothing
- Implemented a TypeId lookup cache, repeated lookups of the same TypeId should be near instant
